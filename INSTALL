# To install PHP-Security:

bash <(curl -sSL 'https://secthemall.com/webapp/setup.txt')

# The script will ask you to insert your SECTHEMALL username and password,
# if you don't have one yet visit https://secthemall.com/signup/ and to choose
# an alias name for the node that you are configuring. After this, it downloads
# all required PHP files and tells you how to include the core functions to
# your application.
