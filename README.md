# SECTHEMALL PHP Security
A **PHP** SDK that makes you able to connect your web application, API or website to your SECTHEMALL account.

> The purpose of this "SECTHEMALL PHP client" is to make your PHP websites and applications more secure, centralize security events and blacklists. It's 100% CloudFlare compatible and makes you able to take control of all events of your application (like login ok, login failed, brute-force attempts, session hijacking, unexpected behaviours, etc...)
> 
> Imagine that you have 10 different PHP applications on your company. Once install SECTHEMALL PHP Security you see that an IP address try to guess the admin password on one of them. With this SDK you can block that IP address on all your applications from your SECTHEMALL dashboard, sending a customizable courtesy page to the user that says: "sorry, you were blocked. For more information, please contact the website administrator." 
>
> Always from the SECTHEMALL dashboard, you can define a rule that automatically blocks an IP address that tries to guess the admin password for more than 5 times, and distributes this block to all others your applications.
