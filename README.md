# SECTHEMALL PHP Security
A **PHP** SDK that makes you able to connect your web application, API or website to your SECTHEMALL account.

> The purpose of this "SECTHEMALL PHP client" is to make your PHP websites and applications more secure, centralize security events and blacklists. It's 100% CloudFlare compatible and makes you able to take control of all events of your application (like login ok, login failed, brute-force attempts, session hijacking, unexpected behaviours, etc...)
> 
> Imagine that you have **10 different PHP applications** on your company. Once install SECTHEMALL PHP Security you see that an IP address **try to guess the admin password** on one of them. With this SDK you can **block that IP address on all your applications from your SECTHEMALL dashboard**, sending a customizable courtesy page to the user that says: "sorry, you were blocked. For more information, please contact the website administrator." 
>
> Always from the SECTHEMALL dashboard, you can **define a rule that automatically blocks an IP address** that tries to guess the admin password for more than 5 times, and distributes this block to all others your applications.
>
> You can use it for both internet or intranet applications (on a **docker container** or not). It's 100% CloudFlare compatible and this means that you log the **real user's IP address**, or you can block all connections from "Non-CloudFlare" IP addresses (this grant you that all traffic will come just from cloudflare servers).
